For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn was a top priority. In this Power BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates. Analyzing churn didnâ€™t just mean knowing what the churn rate was: it was also about figuring out why customers were churning at the rate they were, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.
